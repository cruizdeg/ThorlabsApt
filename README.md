# ThorlabsApt

**NOTE** this code is a semi work in progress I needed it to debug some thorlabs hardware but it is not meant to be a complete working solution. Don't hesitate to contact me for help.

## Installation
This python software works with python 2.7 

To use this package you need to install the packages that are store in doc/requirements.txt

The best is to use a virtual environement you need to install **virtualenv** from your distribution package


    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r doc/requirements.txt


You should now be able to use **test_device.py**
